		<h1>Host Chapter Info</h1>		
		<h3>About Gamma Pi</h3>
		<p>The Purdue chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi is the Gamma Pi chapter. Gamma Pi held its first meeting in 1956 and has been serving the Purdue Bands for over 60 years. Purdue is one of the few colleges without a music school to have a Kappa Kappa Psi chapter.</p>
		<img src="img/speakers/gamma pi.jpg" alt="Gamma Pi" class="host">
		<p>A few of the annual responsibilities held by our chapter include “Lunch for a Buck”, stage crew, and day of service. “Lunch for a Buck” is an event held during the audition week for marching band. During this event, the brothers make hotdogs and provide other food during lunch time between band camp rehearsals for a low price of one dollar.
		<p>During each of our concert weekends, our band department relies on our organization to help with stage crew. This includes set up, stage changes, and tear down of every band and orchestra concert.</p>
		<p>Day of Service is an event held during the fall semester where our chapter completes multiple projects around our music building to help clean up and maintain the quality of our rooms and student led programs.</p> 
		<!--<p>A fun, unique tradition of the Gamma Pi chapter is the hat we wear at all events called a pot. The pots are one of our ways we carry the memories that we make throughout our band and fraternal journey and allow each brother to show their unique story.</p>-->
		
		<h3>About Beta Sigma</h3>
		<p>The Beta Sigma chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was established in 1959 and will be celebrating its 60th anniversary on April 12th, 2019. The sisters of Beta Sigma work closely with our brothers in Gamma Pi and with Purdue's Volunteer Management Team to serve the Purdue Band Department.</p>

		<p>Our chapter builds props for the "All-American" Marching Band, helps facilitate scholarship auditions, and runs a small store, called the Kloset, where we sell band-related items such as reeds or gloves.</p>
		<p>We participate in Day of Service, along with our brothers, to complete various small service projects that our directors request. These projects often involve the upkeep of our Hall of Music, but have also included a large storage move and the building of risers for percussion equipment.</p>
		
		<h3>Uniquely Purdue</h3>
		<p>Purdue's band department is unique because we do not have a school of music. The department is also different than many others because of our VMT, or Volunteer Management Team. This team is made up of volunteers that help facilitate the day-to-day activities of the band department. That means that our service chapters are able to take on larger-scale projects, althogh many of our chapter members also participate in one of the VMT teams.</p>
		<!--TODO: add picture of people wearing pots-->
		<img src="img/purdue band.jpg" alt="Purdue Band" class="host">
		<p>Another tradition that sets Purdue's chapters apart is the use of pots. These are the hats that we wear to convention and other district events. Purdue used to give each freshman a pot when they arrived on campus, and the color of the pot would correspond to their major. Over time, most organizations stopped wearing pots, but both the Gamma Pi and Beta Sigma chapters still use them. We use our pots to commemmorate our time in the band department and in the chapters. Each person's pot is unique, and contains items that are meaningful to its owner. Pots help us to stand out in a crowd, so if you are looking for a host chapter member, look for the blue pots!</p>
