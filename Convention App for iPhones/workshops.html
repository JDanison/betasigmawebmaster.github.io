				<h3 class="wsHead">Alumni 101</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Jennifer Pitts Taylor</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">Alumni will be the longest status that one will hold as a Brother of Kappa Kappa Psi. Often, we get lost in the transition from active to alumni status. What does it look like to be an alumni Brother?

				<h3 class="wsHead">Personal Accountability</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Marc Renaud</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">This workshop will take a look at tools we can use to hold ourselves and each other accountable as brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi. For this discussion will we draw upon sections of the ritual that can be used to reaffirm who we are as brothers and what we strive to accomplish. Words are often said but saying words without meaning will not take us to new heights. In addition to aspects of the ritual we will talk about motivation, prioritizing, and visions, and how these can be used as aids to accountability. </p>

				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Alaina Peters</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">Knowing the black-and-white text responsibilities of being an officer doesn’t make you a great leader… In fact, you don’t even need to be an officer to be a great leader! This workshop will allow Brothers to reflect on their personal values, how they are—or aren’t—able to apply them to their passion areas within the fraternity, and create a unique fraternity experience that is both personally fulfilling and beneficial to others.  </p>

				<h3 class="wsHead">"We Love You, You're Perfect...Now Change": Recruiting and Embracing a Diverse Membership</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Erika Pope</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc"> It is an honor to be selected to serve. However, the many ways in which we serve our bands, though drawn from a common place of commitment, has proven to be very unique and diverse from campus to campus. Band service doesn't just happen, it takes an elite group of individuals pulling together to achieve the highest level of functionality; so how do we maintain a legacy of organizational dependability and ensure that we have "the right people in the right seats" on the bus of band service? In this workshop we'll be discussing the reasons we recruit and why considering diversity in recruitment strategies is important. We'll also discuss ways to embrace the differences between our members for the enhancement of the chapter experience. Like a lot of things in life: It's all about relationships!</p>
				<p>This workshop will be held in Salon A from 9:30 - 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.</p>

				<h3 class="wsHead">Talk Less. Smile More.</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Carolyn McCambridge</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">Finding yourself in a position of leadership and being in a leadership position are two different concepts yet both have the potential to make a dynamic impact within your band. In this workshop we will explore the opportunities for positional, non positional, and intentional leadership within your chapter and how every member can use these theories to make an impact in both your chapter and your band.</p>

				<h3 class="wsHead">Joint Relations: Finding the Right Chemistry</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Jack Lee</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma – two things that go together like cookies and milk.  But what happens when the interaction is more like oil and water?  Do you find common ground and do what is best for your band program and the moment, or do you come to a standstill with no idea of what to do next?  This workshop is built to help Sisters and Brothers understand each other, find common ground, and develop the best ways to work together, while also giving the other organization the space that we all sometimes need.</p>

				<h3 class="wsHead">Resilience</h3> 
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Tammi Ramsey</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">What the new buzzword means for personal growth. We seem to be hearing the word 'resilience'  in many conversations, but what does that mean for you personally?

				<h3 class="wsHead">“Old Wine in New Bottles”: Embracing New Ideas in Traditional Chapter Functions</h3>
				<h4 class="hostHead">Hosted by Nicholas Bratcher</h4>
				<p class="wsDesc">Arguably, one thing any successful chapter must do is have consistent membership intake. However, many times, once initiated, newer members feel as if they don’t always have a voice or feel comfortable voicing newer ideas and perspectives to an otherwise older and “seasoned” chapter populace. This clinic is geared towards providing support, strategies, motivation, and resources to all of the “wallflowers” of chapter meetings everywhere.</p>
				<p>This workshop will be held in Salon D from 9:30 - 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.</p>
